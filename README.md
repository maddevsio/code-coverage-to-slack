## What is it?
This is a simple example (currently, written in Golang) of how we can send a code coverage from GitLab CI/CD to messenger like Slack via webhook, and how to generate detailed Code Coverage reports using GitLab Pages as well.

## How it works
- At the Test stage we are running a Go test and saving output to coverage.out file. Go tool cover on this stage is for GitLab CI/CD coverage report
- coverage.out file is saved to Artifacts for next job
- At the Pages stage we are running Go tool cover for getting total coverage, then we will find Total string. Next, we will parse them with awk and get only coverage numbers. Then with the xargs and curl we send coverage percent to Slack via webhook.
- We create a .HTML file from coverage.out with Go tool cover, which generates pretty formatted HTML with coverage. After this, we create a public folder and move index.html inside. GtLab always deploys your website from a very specific folder called public in your repository. When you create a new project in GitLab, a repository becomes available automatically
- If Pages stage successfully done - you will see a new job in the CI pipeline like pages:deploy, created by GitLab
- Go to your repository GitLab Pages (https://your-url.gitlab.io/your-repo/) where you will see your detailed coverage report
